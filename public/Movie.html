<html><h1>The Best Movie According to Nikhil</h1>
<H2>My Top 3 movies of All-Time</H2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Probably the Best movie in my opinion. The only movie in sci-fi gerner that made audiance part of the sci-fi story after '2001:A space Odyssey'</p>
<h3>OldBoy</h3>
<p>Park Chan Wook's best work in his own gerner of Suspense Thriller. No end twist can be as hard hitting as this. The slowburn of the story hits so different. The best thriller still gives me chills to the spine. The fights are absolute classics.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>It is a real classic is the only word . David Flincher's best work in my opinion . It is a satarical way of  displaying modern societical life. Made me remember American Psycho</p>
